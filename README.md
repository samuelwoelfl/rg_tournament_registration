# Roundnet Germany Tournament Registration Script

## Requirements
- Python
- Selenium package (https://pypi.org/project/selenium/)

## Test the script before using
The script has a test mode where it runs through everything except the final registration click to test if everything is still working. It would be best to run the script in the TEST mode a day before registration to make sure it works.
 
## How to use
1. Download the script.py file
2. Edit the variables at the top in the script.py file (Don't forget to change the `mode = "RUN"`)
3. Run the script few minutes before the registration starts
4. While the script is running look at the console to see if everything is running correct
5. Get registered :D
